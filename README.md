# os
The Nexus OS creator allows administrators of a Nexus system to build custom operating systems based on NixOS, the declarative platform Nexus is built upon.

## requirements
Git LFS is needed to track the OS creator VM.

This project runs inside a **devcontainer**, so Docker Engine and a devcontainer-supporting IDE is required.

## usage
not done yet :( \
will be ready soon tho
