# os
The Nexus OS creator allows administrators of a Nexus system to build custom operating systems based on NixOS, the declarative platform Nexus is built upon.

## requirements
Git LFS is needed to track the OS creator VM. Flutter is needed for UI work. Direnv and Devbox may be required in the future to manage other dependencies.

This project will one day live inside a devcontainer, pending the closure of a few blocking IDEA issues.

## usage
not done yet :( \
will be ready soon tho
